>>Software Architectures:                            (application-appln)
 1.ONE-TIER
 2.TWO-TIER
 3.THREE-TIER
 4.N-TIER

>TIER=SERVER=LAYER

>SERVER:
-server serves the services two the end user.
-three servers in real time are:
   -Web server
   -App server
   -Db server

1.Web Server:
-It is also called as presentation layer.
-It is used to show(frontend) the application.
-Who works here? UI/UX Developer.
-What they use? Web Technologies(eg : html , Css , Js)

2.App Server:

-Who works here? DB admins(team)
-What they use? DB language(SQL,Oracle,Postgress,etc)

Architectures:

1.ONE-TIER:
-It is stand alone appln
-App will work on local Laptops
-It will not require internet connection
-eg: VLC Media Player
-all layers will be on locally

2.TWO-TIER:
-Client-Server appln
-App will work on local laptops
-local-Presentation ,logic.
 DB-Internet
-eg: Banking appln(whenever u go in bank they say server issue).


3.THREE-TIER:
-Web appln
-Appln no need to be on local
-everything we can use from internet.
-eg: Instagram, Facebook , YouTube, etc
